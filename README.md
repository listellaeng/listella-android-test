## Android Coding Test

Thanks for taking the time to try out our coding challenge. Since we don't do a lot of whiteboarding during the interview process we've found take-home problems to be the best way for you to show us your skills. This gives you the chance to think about the problem, solve it when you feel comfortable, and focus on the areas you think are important. This challenge should take you 3 - 4 hours on the keyboard, but we encourage you to read the problem description and take some time to think about your solution before you dive into it :)

### Overview
Create a Jetpack Compose application that does the following:
* Replicates the UI/UX designs in Figma. 
* Displays the APOD (Astrological Photo of the Day). 
* Displays Mars Rover photos filtered by which rover took the photo (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit). 
* Displays NASA photos, sorted chronologically. 
* Displays each photo in its own view when selected. 
* Displays a UI for uploading photos to the Nasa API. 

Please feel free to put your own spin on the project, and take it anywhere you feel would result in the best application.


### Scoring


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Basics
   </td>
   <td>Does your application build? Does it read and write data in the way we'd like it to? Is it properly formatted?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Completeness
   </td>
   <td>Do you handle all cases? What types of files and metadata are handled? Why were those chosen? Try to cover as much as you can
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Error Handling
   </td>
   <td>How are you handling edge cases? What happens when errors occur? What choices have you made to deal with potential error causes and states?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Efficiency
   </td>
   <td>What limitations are placed on size or type? How have you optimized for large file handling?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Maintainability
   </td>
   <td>In this case clean code is more important than efficient code because humans will have to read and review your code without an opportunity for
<p>
you to explain it. Inefficient code can often be improved if it is correct and highly maintainable
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Safety and Robustness
   </td>
   <td>How are you handling potentially unsafe access and data inputs? 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Your solution will be scored using a combination of automated and manual scoring. Automated

scoring will be used to run your solution against a handful of sample inputs, comparing the

resulting output. If our automatic test suite passes, manual scoring will be used for everything

else. At Listella we care about clean, correct, safe, and efficient code.
